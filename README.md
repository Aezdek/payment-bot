# Aezek's Payment Bot
### Why use this bot?
Do you forget your payment info or just do not want to remember it?
##### Its easy with Aezdek's Payment bot
The `bot` remembers all your **`payment`** information, therefore providing a `reliable and ease to use experience`

### Seting up the bot
Goto **terminal/cmd** and execute the following
```bat
npm i discord.js @discordjs/rest discord-api-types/v9 fs dotenv
```
### Now we configure the bot
Open the `.env` file provided and fill bot's information. `.env` file looks like this.
![envfile.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109069097825751081/1114508388349522010/image.png "env image.")

### Starting the bot
We can start the **bot** by running the following `node.js` command
```bat
node .
```
### If that does not work do
```bat
node src/index.js
```
### Using the bot
You can now use [/] commands (without brackets, e.g., /paypal) to find your payment information, but if your payment information was not set in the `.env` file, it will not show your payment information!
### Thank you
Thank you for reading this and using this bot.
